		<h4 class="player">Round 1: Justing Pugh</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Reese-on-OL-Justin-Pugh-strengths/d71db152-b4f4-4d34-a18b-0ce0e5f09365" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |

				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Director-of-College-Scouting-Marc-Ross/c20033cc-9e5d-4541-8aa6-56ea431932a6" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em> Junior entry, but a three-year starter. Pugh has a nice combination of size and athleticism, although he lacks ideal arm length for a tackle. Pugh has the quick feet and fluidity to play left tackle, but he is versatile enough to play any of the five offensive line positions. He is more of a technician and position blocker than mauler, but Pugh is a very good technician with little wasted movement. Consistent and efficient. He plays with very good leverage. Pugh is very solid in pass protection and will surprise defenders with his strong hands. His mobility allows him to effectively block defenders at the second level – Pugh can pull, trap, and block on screen plays. Pugh is extremely smart, competitive, and hardworking. Unlike most rookies, Pugh could press for a starting job right away. He should get bigger and stronger in an NFL training program.</p>


		<h4 class="player">Round 2: Jonathan Hankins</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-on-DT-Hankins-and-DE-Moore/5059f2a0-ca4f-451a-b7d0-b248f877dd9f" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Marc-Ross-on-why-Giants-chose-DT-Hankins/d66e9228-6eab-4f13-ad5b-a6d3b925b078" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Coach-Tom-Coughlin-explains-Fridays-draft-choices/3c706763-5332-41f0-a3e2-3a1f34d4873f" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Junior entry, but a two-year starter. Hankins is a big, strong, run-stuffing defensive tackle with good athletic ability and agility for his size. He is a better run defender than pass rusher. Hankins is very stout at the point-of-attack and can take on double-team blocks. When he plays with leverage and proper technique, Hankins is very difficult to move off of the line of scrimmage. Hankins also has the athletic ability to pursue down the line and will flash occasionally on the pass rush with quickness and power. He has good lateral agility and even dropped into coverage at times in college. The biggest knock on Hankins is his inconsistency. At times, he dominated in college; at other times, he disappeared from the action. However, he played a lot of snaps in each game and wore down. He should perform more consistently in a rotation and with better conditioning. When not out of gas, Hankins plays hard. Hankins has the tools (size, strength, power, quickness) to excel at the NFL level if he wants it badly enough.</p>


			<h4 class="player">Round 3: Damontre Moore</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-on-DT-Hankins-and-DE-Moore/5059f2a0-ca4f-451a-b7d0-b248f877dd9f" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Coach-Tom-Coughlin-explains-Fridays-draft-choices/3c706763-5332-41f0-a3e2-3a1f34d4873f" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Marc-Ross-on-DE-Damontre-Moore/275a88ab-2624-49d3-b6a2-652be782d945" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Junior entry, but a two-year starter. Moore lacks ideal size and timed speed, but he is an athletic disruptor who plays hard and makes a lot of plays in the backfield. He has good first-step quickness, agility, and change-of-direction skills. Moore has very long arms. Moore is a better pass rusher than run defender. Relentless getting after the quarterback, but he can be handled at the point-of-attack on running plays. He needs to get stronger and add some bulk – still growing into his body. He tested and interviewed very poorly at the NFL Combine, but the production was there on gameday. Moore has some character concerns, including a drug possession charge. He needs to improve his off-the-field work ethic and commitment to the game. Moore has the tools to become a very good player if he wants it.</p>


			<h4 class="player">Round 4: Ryan Nassib</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-on-trading-up-for-Nassib/2888bf83-1ebf-4ace-914d-485d398bfda7" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Marc-Ross-explains-trading-up-for-QB-Nassib/7c286963-ad66-4bb2-bb1c-1f4eca97b6d1" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Three-year starter. Nassib lacks ideal height and mobility, but he is a well-built quarterback with a good (not great) arm. He is very smart and has the mental capacity to handle a complicated pro passing offense – Nassib played in two pro style offenses in college. Nassib is also mentally and physically tough. Nassib can make all of the NFL throws. He demonstrates good velocity, touch, and accuracy on his passes. He does need to improve his overall footwork, and accuracy on deep passes. Nassib has very good intangibles – mature, hardworking, confident, and competitive. He is a clutch player who has a history of winning games on the last drive. Football is extremely important to him. A leader on the field.</p>


			<h4 class="player">Round 5: Cooper Taylor</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-talks-Day-Three-selections/100e77fc-f72a-4f73-9aa0-92e3bfd2725e" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Marc-Ross-explains-trading-up-for-QB-Nassib/7c286963-ad66-4bb2-bb1c-1f4eca97b6d1" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Georgia Tech transfer due to a heart condition. Taylor is a huge safety with very good timed-speed, agility, and overall athleticism for his size. Strong. Taylor is an aggressive, physical safety who will hit. Taylor impressed sharp during East-West Shrine Game practices, taking to coaching well and showing good instincts. He should excel on special teams.</p>


			<h4 class="player">Round 7: Eric Herman</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-talks-Day-Three-selections/100e77fc-f72a-4f73-9aa0-92e3bfd2725e" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Four-year starter. Herman is a big, strong mauler who is a better run blocker than pass blocker. He lacks ideal athleticism and arm length. Herman can overpower opposing defenders, but he sometimes struggles with quickness and speed. Aggressive, physical, and competitive. Herman is a better in-line blocker than space player – not great at pulling or getting to the second level. Hard worker who could develop into a solid right guard.</p>


			<h4 class="player">Round 7: Michael Cox</h4>
			<p>What the staff has to say:
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/GM-Jerry-Reese-talks-Day-Three-selections/100e77fc-f72a-4f73-9aa0-92e3bfd2725e" target="_blank">GM Jerry Reese</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="-blank">Coach Coughlin</a>  |  
				<a href="http://www.giants.com/media-vault/videos/Tom-Coughlin-on-2013-Draft/47f87a69-c125-4263-9687-0e7e913a8d69" target="_blank">Scouting Director Marc Ross</a>
			</p>
			<p><em>Scouting Report:</em>Michigan transfer. Cox is a big, strong back with decent speed and elusiveness. He catches the ball well.</p>
